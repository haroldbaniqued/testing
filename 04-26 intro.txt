C# 6.0

Hello World!

|
| Statements and Expressions
|__________________________
Staments 
-statements is an instruction in C#
-ends with semi-colon ";"
-whitespaces doesn't matter (but whitespaces are essential to make the code readable, 3 spaces)

Expressions
-a statement that evaluates to a value

Bugs
-Compile time //during the development, before running the application
-Run time //during the run of the application
-Compile time bugs are better than run time // compile time > run time

|
|Workflow compiling
|_____________________
Code you write -> Intermediate Language (IL) -> Executable -> Running
              └compile time bugs here                            └run time bugs here

|			  
|Variables
|__________
Variable - value holder //holder for a value
-it has type (eg. int)
-it has an identifier (eg. myAge)
-it has a value that may change during the running of the program

statically type - c#, variables are identified during the compile time.
dynamic type - javascript, variables are identified during run time


|If statements
|______________

|
|Truth
|_______
&& and, both must be true
|| or, atleast one must be true

AND
1st   |2nd   |result
true  |true  |true
true  |false |false
false |true  |false
false |false |false

OR
1st   |2nd   |result
true  |true  |true
true  |false |true
false |true  |true
false |false |false 

| Increment/Decrement
|_____________________

|
| For loop
|__________
initialization, condition, increment/decrement

|
| While and do while loop
|__________________________

While loop - conditions are checked first after executing the codes
do while - statements are executed atleast once and check the condition after it.

|
| Constants
|______________
Constants - values that never changes.
-easier to fix a value used in many places.

|
| Enumerated Constants
|__________________________
Enums - gives an invididual value to each set
-simplify programing
-by default, starts at zero and increments by 1.
 
  enum Actions {
	  Create, //0 
	  Delete, //1 
	  Save    //2
  }
