instance - actual object

class have properties and methods(behaviour)

Function - it will be a method if attached to an object

class default is INTERNAL (inside the project)
properties default is PRIVATE

access modifier = PUBLIC, PRIVATE, INTERNAL, PROTECTED (inherited subclass only)

//--- NAMING CONVENTIONS

camel case, pascal case, hungarian notation

camel case - small letter first

--for special cases like setting default values
--called when instantiated by the project
